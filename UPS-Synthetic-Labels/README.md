# Code128 and MaxiCode Dataset

This repository contains a small, **synthetic dataset of UPS-style shipping labels** created to test barcode decoding performance — especially for **Code128** and **MaxiCode** symbologies.

Each label mimics a real-world UPS shipping label layout, including two Code128 barcodes and one MaxiCode, with realistic tracking numbers and address patterns. The images are synthetically generated and **do not represent real shipments or personal data**.
